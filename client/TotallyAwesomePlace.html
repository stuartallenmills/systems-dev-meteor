   <div><h3>Support your community while helping yourself!</h3></div>
   
    <span style="font-size:20px;">M</span>ore and more people are using their smart phones for the internet, and sharing results with their friends using Facebook, Google+, Twitter, or email.  
<br><br>
   <strong> &lt; your community &gt;.totallyawesomeplace.org</strong> aggressively promotes your business and your community and region using a web design that while specifically targeting smart phones, works as well on tablets and desktops.  <strong>totallyawesomeplace.org</strong> also has a Facebook page, Google+ page, and Twitter account for each community.
<br><br>
Example communities are
<strong>
rogueriver.totallyawesomesomeplace.com, 
grantspass.totallyawesomeplace.com, 
centralpoint.totallyawesomeplace.com,
ashland.totallyawesomeplace.com <br> <br>
</strong>

And the region including all of the above is <strong> roguevalley.totallyawesomeplace.com </strong><br><br>

We have a number of products designed to allow every  business to participate: a Sponsorship, an Entry, Mobile Pages, and Mobile Website, and Social Media support.
<br><br>
<strong>More than 50% of the monthly fees will be spent on ads (such as Google AdWords) to bring new people to the Grants Pass area.</strong> 

<br><br>
The monthly fees are offered in 2 tiers - primary and secondary.  The primary tier are those products/services that have a high probability of benefiting from "captures".  This would include restaurants, hotels, rafting/kayaking etc.  The second tier would be grocery stores, doctors, dentists, auto service, etc.

<br><br>
 <h3>Sponsorship</h3>
 A sponsorship  is a small textbox that provides name, address, phone number, and a brief description.  It can link to an external website, including a page on <strong>Grants Pass Is Awesome</strong>.  Sponsors  can indicate which pages they wish to be displayed on.
 
<span class="visit" > visit our sponsor:</span>
<div class="sponsor">
  <div class="sponAdd "><a href="#">Dan's Sporting Goods</a> <br>
        555 7th St <br>
        Grants Pass, OR 95726 <br>
        P:<a href="tel:+18189706055">504-555-5555</a>   
	</div>
	<div class="sptext " style="line-height:16px;">
	    Hiking and Camping Gear.
	</div>
 </div>
</div>

Each sponsor spot requires $10 set up and $5/month for primary tier, $3 month for secondary.

<br><br>
<h3>Entry</h3>
An Entry is a Picture link with a title and a tag that is under one of <strong>grantspass.totallyawesomeplace.org</strong> defined categories.  An example would be "The Eatery" under the "Restaurant" category.  The link can be to an external site, or, ideally, a mobile optimized page (or pages) on the Grant's Pass is Awesome site.
<br><br>
<div style="width:100%; margin-bottom:10px; padding-bottom:10px; display:block; float:left">
    <div class="blk" >		
        <div class="blkbimg" style="background-image:url('images/grantspass/restaurant/eatery_256.jpg'); background-size:cover;" >
        </div>
        <div class="blktxt">
            <div class="blkblkTitle"><a href="eatery2.html">The Eatery</a>  </div> 
            <div class="blkblurb">Great Food. Good Times.</div>
        </div>
    </div>
</div>
					
<br><br>
An Entry that links to an external site requires $15 set up and $10/month for primary tier, $5 month for secondary tier.  Entries for our pages are free.

<br><br>
<h3>Mobile Pages</h3>
Mobile pages is one or more web pages  with social media links so that people can easily share the site with friends, and follow your business on Facebook, Google+, and Twitter (if you don't have those accounts we can help set you up).  It can be single simple page, and can link to your external website, or can be a complete, multiple page site that outlines all aspects of you business.  

Mobile pages are accessed from the web using the address: <br> http://grantspass.totallyawesomeplace.com/{companyname}.html

The pages will be optimized for search engines, and fully annotated with  schema.org mark-up, which allows the search engines to "understand" what the site is offering, which results in optimal search results.

The mobile pages design, format  and overall presentation would be optimized for your business.

The initial design and setup for the pages depends entirely upon the complexity of the site.  A single page with a banner picture, texts, hours of operation, and a map can be as low as $30.
<br><br>

<iframe src="eatery2.html" height="400px" style="border:1px solid;"></iframe>

<br><br>

Mobile Pages are $20/month plus $2 per page for primary, $12 month plus $2 page for secondary.

<br><br>

<h3>Mobile Website</h3>
A Mobile Website is one or more Mobile Pages that use your company's domain name.  If you don't already have a domain name, we can get one for you.  If you do have a domain name, we can configure your site so that requests from mobile browsers automatically go to the Mobile Website.  A new domain name costs $30.  Configuring an existing site to go to the mobile website for mobile browsers is $20.



<br><br>
<h3>Social Media</h3>

Social Media is now the key to business success.  We will help setup Facebook, Google+, and Twitter accounts.  

Basic Facebook and Google+ set-ups are $30 each, Twitter is $20.  

We can monitor those accounts, and Yelp as well, and provide status reports, and immediately report any bad reviews or comments on any of the sites.  We can update sites with data you provide (such as announcing sales, special events, etc.) if you do not want to do it yourself.

Monitoring and updating are $20/month plus $10/hr for updating that requires more than 2hrs.  This rate applies to both primary and secondary.

<br><br>
    <h3>Advertising </h3>
    <strong>grantspass.totallyawesomeplace.org</strong> will use Google AdWords for the bulk of its advertising expenditures, initially focusing on Oregon and California.
    <br><br>
    If you would like to independently  advertise your product or service  in a specific region (only Grants Pass for a restaurant, or only Los Angeles for a rafting service, for example) we can help you set up Google AdWords to meet your requirements.  Initial setup is $30.  Monitoring and reporting is $15 month (or you can do it yourself for free).  Google AdWords requires a minimum of $50 a month.  You only pay if someone actually clicks on the link of the add.  Click prices vary widely.
<br><br>
    <h3>Training/Consulting</h3>
If you have a website and social media contract with us then training/consulting is charged at $15 hr.  Otherwise the rate is $25 hr.
<br>
<br>


<h3>Hosting Capabilities</h3>
<strong>grantspass.totallyawesomeplace.org</strong> is hosted in the cloud using Amazon Web Services.  This ensures close to 100% uptime and data integrity.  Nginx servers are used, which are considered the fastest available.

Load times are critical for mobile applications where people can, and will, "switch the channel" if load times become excessive.

For this reason our team ensures that any site we design not only is optimized for use on mobile platforms, but is optimized to minimize load times as well.
